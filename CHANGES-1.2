Summary of changes for Version 1.2 
==================================

New features
------------

* ImageJ plugin can now reconstruct QuickPalm runs as well as 3B runs

* Program for splitting large marked areas into a grid for parallel processing.
  See: http://superresolved.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=30218
  - Split large masks up into small ones
  - Automatically dilate masks to create overlap
  - Reconstruction supports filtering to properly reconstruct overlapping regions

* Abort the computation early if the model size is too small for too long.
  - New parameters are:
      main.consecutive_empty_models
      main.empty_model.max_size
 
* Release version inclues statically compiled 32 and 64 bit linux executables
  for use on clusters as well as plugin and code.

* Log files now embed the 3B version number

* Automatic system for building plugin and executables from stable Ubuntu LTS 
  releases.
  - From any Debian based system (debootstrap required!), type:
      sudo bash build_plugin.sh  

* ImageJ plugin for 64 bit Windows



Bugs fixed
----------

* ImageJ plugin supports ImageJ scripts properly now.

* Fixed annoying rounding bug which made reconstructed images harder to align
* with the originals

* Fix bug in main optimization algorithm which drastically reduced the efficiency
  - Note this changes the algorithm so the results are not the same as before
  - The original algorithm is still available. Choose using:
      main.optimization_version

* Precompiled binary now works on older AMD x86-64 processors (such as Phenom II X6)

* Occasional incorrect behaviour on continuing stopped runs
